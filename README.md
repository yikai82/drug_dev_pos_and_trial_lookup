# drug_dev_pos_and_trial_lookup
A little tool to look up the drug development success rate and the National Clinical Trial (NTC) number in the US (ClinicalTrials.gov) using Python 3

# Drug Development Possibility Estimation & Clinical Trial Lookup Tool

This project is a portfolio-ready Jupyter Notebook designed to support biotech investment research and drug development due diligence.

### 🔍 Features

- **Probability of Success (PoS) Modeling**  
  Calculates estimated clinical success rates based on therapeutic indication and historical data (BIO 2011–2020).

- **ClinicalTrials.gov API Integration**  
  Searches for real clinical trials by keyword (e.g., condition, company, or drug name), returning phase, status, and other metadata.

### 💡 Use Cases

- Investment analysts evaluating biotech pipelines  
- CDMO professionals assessing therapeutic risk  
- Researchers or students learning about clinical trial stages
